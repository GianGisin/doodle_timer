## How to install

1. Download the main.exe file from [here](https://github.com/GianGisin/doodle_timer/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
2. Put the main.exe file into a new folder somewhere on your device
3. inside the new folder, create another folder called img
4. Take a screenshot of the "game paused" and "you win" text in the game. Make sure the browser window has the same size as when you play. E.g. if you play with the browser window maximized, take the screenshots while the window is maximized.
![win](img/win.png)
![pause](img/pause.png)
The screenshots should look something like the above. They don't need to be exact though.

5. Place the images in the img folder and name them win.png and paused.png respectively

## How to use

1. Open the folder where main.exe is located. Right click in the explorer and open in terminal.
2. type main and hit enter
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal

For the best results, you may want to activate the "always on top" option in settings/appearance (make sure you click save before you close the tab)
